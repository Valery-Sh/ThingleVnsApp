<h2 class="h2-blue">Our Vision</h2>

<h3>Who we are?</h3>

<p>We are a social media company passionate about things. We have created
Thingle to enable people to create, collect, organize and share their passions in an
optimal way, digitally.
We celebrate passion. We are moved when people find their own passion. We
promote any passion (within the limits of the law of course). We respect others and we believe everyone has something to be passionate about. We respect people who have built their lives around their passions. You can find a lot of examples here on our platform and be inspired.
Our vision is to create an inspiring site that brings people together through sharing their passions and contributing to the Thingles other people have shared. We want Thingles to become bundles of information in the form of images, comments, links - and in the later editions – music, video, or any form of digital content. These Thingles can currently be shared, but there will also be an opportunity to do a lot
more in the future.</p>

<h3>Our values</h3>

<p>We are an energetic young company who wants to create a great social media
experience. For us that means we are passionate about the user and the user
experience. We aim to give the user full control and transparency and for example
not push unwanted advertising onto their wall. Please let us know how the platform
experience is for you. If something is not right, let us know and we will see if we can
make it better.

We hope to build a transparent, diverse and ethical community with motivating,
inspiring and fabulous content. We invite everyone to join our site and encourage
everyone to build exciting content. If however, you see something that shouldn’t be
there, kindly notify us immediately</p>

<p>This is Thingle. Be passionate.</p>
