<h2 class="h2-blue">Welcome to Thingle</h2>

<p>Discover, collect and share the things you are passionate about.</p>

<p>The Thingle platform lets you arrange information and collect items around the
topics you are most passionate about, as well as share these with others. Once
created or shared on Thingle, your passions become known as <em>Thingles</em>, which you
can organize into personal collections. A <em>Thingle</em> can be a combination of real life
things you’ve photographed or objects or links you find on the web.</p>

<p>Create collections for any topic imaginable, such as fashion, antique cars, favorite
football team or sustainable travel – don’t limit yourself! The possibilities are
endless! Invite your friends to create Thingles, and to comment or contribute about
existing Thingles. By sharing Thingles and contributing to other peoples’ Thingles,
you will discover a whole new world of knowledge, and get to know many more
people and their passions.</p>

<p>We are passionate about creating the most exciting and useful social platform on the
web. This is a Beta version of the site. We are constantly improving the platform and
we have tons of new features in the pipeline. We welcome your comments and
feedback on how to improve our site.</p>

<p>This is Thingle. Be passionate.</p>
