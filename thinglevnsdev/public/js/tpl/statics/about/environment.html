<h2 class="h2-blue">Environmentally friendly</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We looked at the environmental aspect of companies in the internet and decided
that we wanted to be the first environmentally friendly social media company.
Already today we are carbon neutral. We are offsetting all our carbon / CO2
emissions with MyClimate.</p>

<p>However, we are more ambitious than that. We are constantly working on how to
make Thingle a profoundly sustainable company. Environmental thinking is in the
core of everything we do. We are still a small company, and sometimes our
resources are limited, but as we grow we are committed to being innovative and
investing our resources to become a truly sustainable operation.<p>

<p>This is Thingle. Be passionate.</p>
