<h3>What is Thingle - the platform?</h3>

<p>Create, collect, organize, and share your favorite things.</p>

<p>Thingle lets you organize and share the things you are passionate about. Once created or shared on Thingle, your passions become known as thingles, which you can organize into personal Collections. Create Collections for any topic imaginable, such as <a href="#!categories/Architecture%20%26%20Interiors" title="Explore the latest trends in interior design and architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="#!categories/Women%27s%20fashion%20%26%20Accessories" title="Discover clothes, shoes and accessories">fashion</a>, <a href="#!categories/Events" title="See what is happening around cities like New York or Zurich">events</a>, <a href="#!categories/Food%20%26%20Beverages" title="Checkout delicious dishes and drinks">food</a>, <a href="#!categories/Travel%20%26%20Destinations" title="Find your next holiday destination">travel</a> — the possibilities are endless! Invite your friends to create thingles, comment, gather feedback, and make sharing your passions an even more real experience!</p>

<p>Thingle is currently in a beta version, many more features will be revealed in the near future.</p>

<h3>What is a thingle?</h3>

<p>A thingle is an object on the Thingle platform. A thingle can be created by uploading an image from your computer or by capturing it from a website using the <a href="#!about/bookmarklet-tutorial" title="Learn how to use the +thingle bookmarklet"><strong>+thingle</strong> bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>Give a description, add additional images from every angle, include links, and add tags to your thingle to make it your unique find. Share, comment, and keep enriching thingles to go social.</p>

<h3>What is a collection?</h3>

<p>Collections are sets in which you can organize your thingles based on themes, i.e. sets of the things you are passionate about. Collect thingles however you want: “Fast Cars”, “Fashion”, “Watches”, “My Wish List”, “Beautiful Antiques”, “Things That Make Me Smile”. Be creative – it is entirely up to you - there is no limit to how many thingles or collections you can make!</p>

<h3>What is following?</h3>

<p>If you enjoy another user’s Collections of thingles, you may want to follow them. Following someone means you’ll have all of a user’s thingles shown to you in real-time on “People you follow”.</p>

<p>You may follow any person you like on Thingle. Why not invite your friends from facebook or other social media to make your and their experience even more exciting?</p>

<p>You can unfollow users at any time: they will not be notified.</p>
