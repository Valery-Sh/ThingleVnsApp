<p><b>Malware/Phishing:</b> You may not publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another user's browser or computer or to compromise a user's privacy. Selling user names: Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Thingle, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose, where "Services" is defined as follows: Your use of Thingle's products, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Thingle under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Thingle . </p>

<p><b>Spam:</b> You may not use the Thingle service for the purpose of spamming anyone. What constitutes "spamming" will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers.</p>
<p><b>Username Squatting:</b> You may not engage in username squatting. Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be username squatting are the number of accounts created or creating accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts.</p>

Thingle reserves the right to immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in its judgment, you violate these Rules or the Terms of Service.</b></p>
